# Introduction

The objective of this workshop is to change the way you work with R. Rather than
sacrificing the fluidity and immediacy of R's REPL-based programming in the name
of 'Reproducibility', we will find there is a middle way that lets us have both.
That way is the {targets} way.

We start by setting some context:

  - What brought you to this workshop?
  - Have you had any experience with {targets}?
  - What problems do you have that you hope {targets} can solve?
  - Do you anticipate any barriers to moving forward with {targets} in your workplace?

# Overview of the workshop

  - Trying to be a somewhat foundational or like a 'gentle introduction'. The knowledge you need to get value from targets is surprisingly small.
  - We'll spend time up front understanding the core problems targets solves. This will help us articulate the value to our teams.
  - Over the course of the workshop we'll progressively refactor an existing R project, written in a classic style, into a modern targets pipeline. This will let us see the benefits accumulate, as we deploy more and more techniques.
