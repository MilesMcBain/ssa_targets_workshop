# The End

Thanks for your participation. There's more to `{targets}` than we covered here, but I hope you feel on solid enough foundation to take some steps with it.on your own projects.

My general advice is:

  - Keep it simple! Avoid Dynamic Branching and other advanced techiniques until you're either confident, or they're absolutely necessary.
  - Try to keep your `{tarets}` plans (`_targets.R`) really clean and high level. Don't junk them up with a lot of implementation detail (code not in funcions).
    - This retains their value as a review / communication tool.

If you feel able, I would much appreciate your feedback via this [short form](https://forms.gle/eZNiu6v97xc5AQZHA).

If you're working through the workshop content afterward and get stuck, or spot any problems, feel free to raise an issue on the [workshop GitHub repository](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/ssa_targets_workshop).
