Some additional topics. No content here but happy to discuss if there's time:

  - Meta programming with `{targets}`.
    - You can create 'target factories': targets that generate more than one target in your plan.
    - These are away to build domain specific abstractions into our plans
    - See: https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html

  - For large projects `{targets}` supports having muliple plans.
    - I use this a fair bit, and it works well for projects that have separate phases.
    - E.g. maybe there's a phase where you're building a model, and then there's a later phase after it's been 'in production' where you analayse the performance. These could be separate plans in the one project.
    - Be careful about using it to break up a pipeline such that you revert to the classic 'script per pipeline stage' form.
    - See: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/projects.html#multiple-projects
