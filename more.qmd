Some additional topics. No content here but happy to discuss if there's time:

  - Meta programming with `{targets}`.
    - You can create 'target factories': targets that generate more than one target in your plan.
    - These are away to build domain specific abstractions into our plans
    - See: https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html
