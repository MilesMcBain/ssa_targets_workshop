# Shaping computations

- Great magic happens here
  - If you get an Out of Memory on one branch you don't lose all your hours long data processing of completed branches.
    - Process can be resumed with increased memory (e.g. if in cloud), or decreased number of parallel threads.
- You get fine great control of CPU and memory usage:
  - many parallel back ends
  - memory managment options
    - unload all targets after use or keep in memory
